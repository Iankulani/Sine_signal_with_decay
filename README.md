This repository provides MATLAB code for generating a Sine Signal with Decay. The function sound of @Sine_signal_with_decay.m creates a sine wave with an exponentially decaying amplitude, which can simulate the natural fading of sound. The repository also includes an example script to demonstrate how to use the function and visualize the generated signal.
